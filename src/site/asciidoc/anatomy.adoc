== The anatomy of a LTPA2 token

=== What is a LTPA Token?

[quote,'https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wip-mg/2.0.0?topic=authentication-lightweight-third-party-ltpa[IBM^]']
Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) is a single sign-on credential format.

[quote,'https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-nd/8.5.5?topic=authentication-ltpa-ltpa-version-2-tokens[IBM^]']
The Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) token is a specific *type of binary security token*. The web services security implementation *for WebSphere Application Server*, Version 5 and later supports the LTPA Version 1 token. WebSphere Application Server Version 7 and later supports the *LTPA Version 2* token using the JAX-WS runtime environment.

The LtpaToken2 cookie is encoded using enhanced security over the LtpaToken cookie.

[quote,'https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wip-mg/2.0.0?topic=authentication-lightweight-third-party-ltpa[IBM^]']
With LTPA, the user authenticates with the first server that is accessed, by using a user name and password. After authenticating, the user receives an LTPA token, which is only valid for one session. The token is used to identify the user on other servers within the same domain name system, where the servers are configured to use LTPA. Therefore, the user enters a user name and password only once, and the user directory is accessed only once to verify the identity of that user.

[quote,'https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wip-mg/2.0.0?topic=authentication-lightweight-third-party-ltpa[IBM^]']
LTPA can be used with WebSphere® Application Server and Worklight®. The servers must all use the same LDAP server for user authentication.

=== Structure of a LTPA2 token
==== External Structure
How does such a token look like? Well, as mentioned above, it is binary and it is using some sort of security. Since it send over http as a cookie (_named "LtpaToken"_), it is base64 encoded. So here is an example.

If we base64-decode it, it will look like this.

Not so nice, isn't it? Okay, then let's *decrypt* it! The *encryption algorithm is AES-128-CBC with PKCS5/7 padding* and as such we need link:faq.html#where-to-find[the shared secret key]. Now it is not so binary anymore!

=== Internal structure
Let's have closer look at the components of a LTPA token. A token consists of three parts: body, expire and signature. All parts are separated by a percent sign `%`.

image::./images/token-parts.png["token parts",align="center"]

==== Expire
The expire part is the unix timestamp of the last validity date ... *in milliseconds*! I do not know why IBM did that. Maybe they thought seconds would not be precise enough? But that just makes the next point more funnier: *the last three digits are always 000* thus they are back at the precision of seconds!

==== Body
The body contains the actual token payload. It consists of simple key-value pairs with each pair separated by a dollar sign `$` while key and value are delimited by colon `:`. If a value contains one of those special characters it must be escaped by preceding a backslash `\` (_look at the word "user" in the example above_). So, the body is nothing more than a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader)[Java properties file^] with `:` instead of `=` and `$` instead of a line terminator character (e.g. `\n`).

The body can contain any property you want. The only required property is `u` - it contains the distinguished name (DN) of the authenticated user in the LDAP directory. This information is required to build up the security context in your application. The WebSphere Application Server (_or your Spring application_) will have to search for that user in the LDAP, assigns groups/roles and finally sets up the security context. *That's why the authentication gateway (e.g. IBM DataPower®) and application server must have access to the same LDAP directory*. Another key-value in body is `expire` - while it is optional it should be part of the body and have the same value as the expire part of the token.

==== Signature
The signature part is a digital SHA1-RSA signature of the body part and is base64 encoded as well. It is created by the issuer of the token. You need the public key of the issuer to verify the integrity of the token body. But there is at least one flaw: *the expire part is not covered by the signature* and could be changed without notice! Thus it _should_ be read from the content of the body, if present.

=== Difference between LTPA Version 1
Version 1 uses DES-3DES encryption and simple RSA signature without hashing.
